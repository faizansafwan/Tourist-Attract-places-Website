             commonly known as the ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව, is a Buddhist temple\
             in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex\
             of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the\
             tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played\
             an important role in local politics because it is believed that\
             whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country.\
             The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. \
             The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly\
             due to the temple and the relic. Bhikkhus of the two particular\
             chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters conduct daily\
             worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed\
             three times daily: at dawn, at noon, and in the evenings. On\
             Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a\
             herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers\
             called Nanumura Mangallaya; this holy water is believed to contain\
             healing powers and is distributed to those present. The temple\
             sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989,\
             and by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. <br><br> \

             gardens. The rock is known as Sigiriya (see-gee-REE-yah)\
             and holds a special place in the island’s cultural history.\
             It was established as the stronghold of a rogue king over\
             1,500 years ago, and today the Sigiriya complex stands as\
             one of the earliest preserved examples of ancient urban\

             It is known as “the Pearl of the Indian Ocean,” a tribute\

             Located in the Matale District of the Central Province\
             (map), the column of rock is somewhat central to the country.\
             Historians believe the region has been inhabited since the\
             3rd century BCE, making the site one of historical and\
             archaeological significance to Sri Lanka.\
             The rock is known as Sīhāgiri, meaning “Lion Rock,”\
             a nod to the giant animal carved from stone which greeted\
             visitors at the entrance.The site was a temporary capital\
