           is the largest, oldest and most colorful park situated in\
           the heart of Colombo (Cinnamon Gardens), just opposite the\
           colonial style Town Hall building. <br>\
           The park was built during the British rule of Sri Lanka as\
           Victoria Park and remained as Vihara Maha Devi Park, in honor\
           of a famous historical Sinhalese queen, mother of the hero of\
           the nation, King Dutugamunu. <br>\
            \
           This is the largest & most attractive greenery in Colombo and\
           best visited from March to May before the monsoon when most\
           of the flowers are in full bloom.\
           It has well landscaped gardens with a varity of trees,\
           flowers, lotus ponds, fountains, golden image of Buddha,\
           large Statue of Queen Viharamahadevi, and Queen Victoria. On\
           the southeastern side of the park is a special section for\
           children with a small train, a zoo of baby animals, mini\
           aquarium and an amusement park. You will also get to see the\
           elephants from the temple near Beira Lake who are often kept\
           in the park to graze.\
           The park is a perfect place to relax, for shady walks,\
           picnics and most of all a great place to spend your time with\
           your family.<br>\

           "The Colombo Museum as it was called at the beginning was\
           established on 1st January 1877. It founder was Sir William\
           Henry Gregory, the British Governor of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) at\
           the time.<br>\
           The Royal Asiatic Society (CB) was instrumental in bringing\
           to the notice of Gregory on his appointment as Governor\
           in 1872 the need for a public museum with much difficulty \
           the approval of the legislative council was obtained within\
           a year. The Architect of the Public Works Department, J.G.\
           Smither was able to prepare the plans for new structure on\
           Italian architectural style. The construction was completed\
           in 1876 and the Museum commenced it functions in the\
           following year.<br>\
  	       The Authorities of the museum took various steps to display\
           the cultural and natural heritage of the country for this purpose.\
           With the development of the museum to international level, it\
           earned the status of a national museum during the period of\
           Dr. P. E. P. Deraniyagala. He was able to open up branch museums\
           in Jaffna, Kandy and Ratnapura and a full - fledged Department\
           of National Museums was established in 1942 under the act No. 31.\
           The extension of the number of branch museums has now increased\
           to nine and in addition a school science programme and a mobile\
           museum service are also in operation.\
           This process has further been improved by the arrangement\
           of the galleries of the ground floor in a historical sequence\
           and those of the upper galleries on a thematic basis.<br>\

             colonization under foreign rule, and the remnants of\
             those war-fueled ages can be seen in buildings such as\
             the forts at Galle, Colombo and as far north as Jaffna,\
             that still stand today. The Dutch Fort in Negombo (known\
             to some as the Negombo Fort) was an important fort built\
             by the Portuguese approximately 30 kilometres north of\
             Colombo, to defend their stronghold city. <br>\
             Reports claim that when it was first built, the\
             Portuguese-built Negombo Fort was nothing but a square\
             surrounded by walls, with minimal defenses and few soldiers.\
             It was easily captured by the Dutch at the beginning of 1640,\
             and for three years they defended it against the repeated\
             attempts of the Portuguese to reclaim it, until the end of\
             1643. Once the fort was back under Portuguese control, they\
             strengthened its defenses to be able to hold it better under\
             siege. However, despite their precautions, the Dutch\
             recaptured it a month later. <br>\
