          "Koneswaram Temple or Thirukoneswaram is a Hindu temple in\
           Trincomalee which is on the east coast of Sri Lanka. The\
           temple is on a high rock that is surrounded by the sea from\
           the three sides. It has a long history of about three\
           millennia that unfolds up to 1580 BC which is worth\
           discovering and learning.<br> \
           Koneswaram Temple gets its name from the main deity at the\
           temple who is god Shiva. Shiva is also addressed as Eshwar\
           and is above the Thirukunamalai. Thus it was given the name.\
           The word “Konam” is believed to have come from the Old Tamil\
           word which means “the peak”. It is one of the five Eeshwerams\
           that dominated ancient Sri Lanka,\
           In stone inscriptions, it is stated that the temple was\
           started in 1580 BC. This is not confirmed though and still\
           is a mystery. Though it is confirmed that the temple was\
           quite a popular and well-established temple during the\
           arrival of exiled Indian Prince Vijaya back in the 6th\
           century BC.<br> \
           It is also stated that the mother of King Ravana was a devoted\
           devotee to the temple.  It is believed that Ravana created the\
           hot springs for his mother’s last rite. He is a legendary\
           emperor who is believed to have lived 5000 years ago.<br>\

            for those who visit Trincomalee now that the LTTE Terrorists\
            which controlled this area has been completely wiped out.\
            There are 7 hot springs now converted to bathing wells. The\
            temperature of each is slightly different from each other.\
            It is also believed the water from the wells have\
            therapeutic healing powers and can cure many aliments. <br>\
            According to the notice board put by the Pradeshiya Saba at\
            the wells, this well goes back to the times of King Ravana\
            who ruled the country over 5000 years ago. But now it has\
            been accepted that these wells belonged to an great Buddhist\
            monastery which span vast area. Ealamisation of the North\
            and East has destroyed the most of the Buddhist remains in\
            these areas and only few has escaped the wrath of the\
            Eelamists who have taken up to the task of erasing all\
            signs of ancient Buddhist civilization in these areas for\
            the last 30-40 years. <br> \

             "Built in the year 1628 by the Portuguese, the Batticaloa\
              Fort is one of the few remaining strongholds of what once\
              was the result of rapid European expansionism that took\
              place during the 17th century. Located on the island of\
              Puliyanthivu, the Batticaloa Fort has switched hands\
              between several colonial powers, namely from the\
              Portuguese to the Dutch in the year 1638, and from the\
              Dutch to the British in the year 1745. It was used as an\
              important administrative complex during the British\
              colonial era, and still houses many functional government\
              buildings. Intriguingly, the Batticaloa Fort was destroyed\
              at one point, after it was captured by the Dutch, as it\
              was initially deemed unnecessary. The Dutch realising its\
              importance decided to rebuild the fort in 1665, and\
              included some new additions, such as fortified bastions.<br<>\
