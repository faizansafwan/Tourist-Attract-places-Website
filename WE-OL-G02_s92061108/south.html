          southwestern coast of Sri Lanka. This fortress is completed\
          with 14 bastions which is still the best-preserved and best\
          example for the fortified city in Asia built by Europeans by\
          showing the mix of European architectural styles and South\
          Asian traditions. UNESCO declared Galle Dutch Fort as a\
          World Heritage in 1988 under the name of Old Town of Galle\
          and its Fortifications. It covers an area of 52 hectares\
          inside the walls. A lighthouse installed on the Utrecht\
          bastion, and a tower erected for the jubilee of Queen\
          Victoria in 1883. A Protestant church also built in\
          Baroque Style in 1775. The most prominent buildings in\
          the fort complex were the Commandant’s residence, the\
          arsenal and the gun house. <br> \

          the Galle Fort, can best be described as a history hoarder’s\
          paradise.Within these walls, you will find rows, shelves and\
          cupboards full of colonial artefacts, such as collections of\
          antique typewriters, cameras, jewellery, VOC china and other\
          miscellaneous items from yesteryear. There is also an old\
          Dutch well in the courtyard dating back to the year 1763.This\
          fascinating and eccentric museum is the private collection of\
          Abdul Gaffar, a long time resident of Galle. It may also very\
          well be the largest private museum in Sri Lanka. However,\
          unlike other museums, there is no entrance fee and everything\
          here on display is also for sale.In addition to the antiquities\
          on display here, history also sometimes comes alive. You get\
          to see live presentations of traditional crafts such as gem\
          cutting and polishing, as well as the almost lost art of\
          ‘beeralu lace’ embroidery, brought to us by the Portuguese.\
