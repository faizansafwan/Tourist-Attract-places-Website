           was originally 400 feet (122 meters) in height and was the\
           third tallest building in the world at that time. Even today\
           as a brick monument, Jethawanaramaya still remains the\
           tallest of its kind in the world. <br> \
           Jethawanaramaya was built by King Mahasena of Anuradhapura\
           (276-303) was completed by his son Sirimeghavanna. It is\
           believed that this monument was built upon the enclosure\
           where Mahinda Maha Thero was cremated. Recent excavation in\
           the stupa has unearthed a one meter thick brick wall adjacent\
           to a layer of ash and charcoal. This is believed to be the\
           chamber where the remains of the great thero rest.<br> \
           As all other buildings in Anuradhapura this too was subjected\
           to destruction by North Indian Invaders. Then when the\
           Anuradhapura was finally abandoned as the capital in the\
           11th century this stupa with others were covered by the\
           jungle. King Parakramabahu (12th century) in the Pollonaruwa\
           era again tried to renovate this stupa and it was rebuilt to\
           the current height, a reduction from the original height.\
           Today it stands at 232 feet (71 meters) .<br> \

        "The Medirigiriya Watadageya in Sri Lanka was built on a rocky\
        outcrop. It had a single entrance facing north. The doorway was\
        a huge carved stone frame built at the bottom of a staircase.\
        The frame measured 9.75 feet in height and 4.75 feet in breadth.\
        The doorway was followed by a climb of 27 stone steps to a large\
        resting area. Four steps lead from the resting area to the actual\
        Stupa house. The Stupa House had a low stone wall, about a meter\
        tall, which ran around it. Seated against the wall facing the four\
        cardinal directions were four exquisite stone Buddha statues.\
        There was a huge 33 feet-long sleeping Buddha in the Stupa House.\
        The Stupa reigned in the center. <br>\
        The stupa was surrounded by stone pillars in three concentric\
        rings. The outer ring had 32 pillars standing at nine feet, the\
        middle ring 20 pillars standing at 16 feet, and finally, the\
        inner ring had 16 pillars standing at 17 feet. Some\
        archaeologists argue that there never was a roof, while other’s\
        say that the remaining pillars in the ruins still standing prove\
        that they supported a roof. The heights of the rings of pillars\
        point toward a roof that would have been very tall in the center\
        to accommodate the spire of the Stupa, while sloping downward in\
        a dome-like fashion to a comparatively lower point at the outer\
        edges. <br> \
        The ruined but still elegant Medirigiriya Vatadage is a prime\
        example of the advanced stone crafting practiced by the\
        craftsmen of Ceylon throughout the ages.";
